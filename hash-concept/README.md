# Hash Concept 
A simple Go experiment demonstrating how to measure execution time while performing a computational task — in this case, hashing 1,000,000 strings using SHA-256.

## Overview

This project benchmarks how long it takes to generate and hash a series of strings using Go’s standard library.
It’s useful for learning about:

The crypto/sha256 package

Basic for-loops and string formatting

Measuring execution time with time.Since()
